Welcome to sphericart's documentation!
======================================


This is the documentation for ``sphericart``, a multi-language library 
for the efficient calculation of spherical harmonics and their 
derivatives in Cartesian coordinates. The theory behind this efficient 
implementation is detailed in this `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08381>`_. 

The library is natively available in Python, C and C++. In addition, our 
PyTorch-based implementation also provides fast spherical harmonics evaluation 
on GPUs.

This documentation contains two quick guides on how to install and use
the library, as well as a more comprehensive display of the API.
